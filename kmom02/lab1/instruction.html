<p>Here you will find everything this lab will go through and much more.</p>


<h2>1. Integers, floats and variables</h2>
<p>The foundation of variables, numbers, strings and basic arithmetic. In questions 1.5 and 1.6 you are going to work with floats. One way to round a float to a certain amount of decimals is:  Math.round(val*10000)/10000, where &#8216;val&#8217; is your float number.</p>


<h3>Exercise 1.1</h3>
<p>Create a variable called &#8216;numberOne&#8217; and give it the value 376. Create another variable called &#8216;numberTwo&#8217; and give it the value 762. Create a third variable called &#8216;result&#8217; and assign to it the sum of the first two variables.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.2</h3>
<p>Use your two variables, &#8216;numberOne&#8217; and &#8216;numberTwo&#8217;. Create one more, called &#8216;numberThree&#8217; and give it the value: 923. Use your variable &#8216;result&#8217; and assign to it the sum of all three variables.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.3</h3>
<p>Use your variables &#8216;numberOne&#8217; and &#8216;numberTwo&#8217; and answer with the product of the numbers in your &#8216;result&#8217;-variable.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.4</h3>
<p>Use your variables &#8216;numberOne&#8217;, &#8216;numberTwo&#8217; and &#8216;numberThree&#8217;. Subtract &#8216;numberThree&#8217; from the product of the other two variables.</p>

<p>Answer with your &#8216;result&#8217;-variable.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.5</h3>
<p>Create two variables, &#8216;floatOne&#8217; and &#8216;floatTwo&#8217;. Give them the values: 741.86 and 610.57. Use your &#8216;result&#8217;-variable and assign to it the sum of the float numbers.</p>

<p>Answer with the result.</p>






<h3>Exercise 1.6</h3>
<p>Answer with the result of 128 modulus (%) 56.</p>
